Thank you for buying the I2 Localization!

Documentation can be found here: http://www.inter-illusion.com/assets/I2LocalizationManual/I2LocalizationManual.html

A few basic tutorials and more info: http://www.inter-illusion.com/tools/i2-localization

If you have any questions, suggestions, comments or feature requests, please
drop by the I2 forum: http://www.inter-illusion.com/forum/index

----------------------
  Installation
----------------------

1- Import the plugin package into a Unity project.
2- Enable the support for third party plugins installed on the project 
   (Menu: Tools\I2 Localization\Enable Plugins)
3- Open any of the example scenes to see how to setup and localize Components
   (Assets/I2/Localization/Examples)
4- To create your own localizations, open the prefab I2\Localization\Resources\I2Languages   
5- Create the languages you will support.
6- The I2Languages source is a global source accessible by all scenes

The documentation provides further explanaition on each of those steps and some tutorials.
Also its presented how to convert an existing NGUI localization into the I2 Localization system.

-----------------------
  Troubleshooting
-----------------------

This plugins contains several dll to access GoogleAPI funtionality. 
If some other plugin already installed those dlls into the project there will be some warnings.
That could be fixed by removing the duplicated dlls from either of the plugins


-----------------------
 Ratings
-----------------------

If you find this plugin to be useful and want to recommend others to use it. 
Please leave a review or rate it on the Asset Store. 
That will help with the sales and allow me to invest more time improving the plugin!!
